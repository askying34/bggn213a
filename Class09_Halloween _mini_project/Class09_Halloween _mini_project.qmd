# 1. Importing candy data

```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.csv"
candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

> **Q1.** How many different candy types are in this dataset?

> **A1.** There are 85 different candy types are in this dataset

```{r}
dim(candy)
nrow(candy)
# How many variables/dimensions are there?
ncol(candy)
```

> **Q2.** How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

> **A2.** There are 38 fruity candy types

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

# 2. What is your favorate candy?

## data exploration

> **Q3.** What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

> **A3.** My favorite candy is Snickers, its winpercent value is 76.67378.

```{r}
candy["Snickers", ]$winpercent
```

> **Q4.** What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```

> **Q5.** What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```

```{r}
library("skimr")
skimr::skim(candy)
```

> **Q6.** Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

> **A6.** Yes. The "winpercent" looks to be on a different scale. The mean value for "winpercent" is 50.32 with a sd of 14.71, which indicates a relatively wide spread of values around the mean.

> **Q7.** What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy\$chocolate column?

> **A7.** In the candy\$chocolate column, a zero and one represent binary values indicating the presence or absence of chocolate in the respective candies. 0: Indicates that the candy does not contain chocolate. 1: Indicates that the candy contains chocolate

> **Q8.** Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 8)
```

> **Q9.** Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

> **A9.** No

> **Q10.** Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

> **A10.** Below 50%

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```

> **Q11.** On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruity candy?

> **A11.** Chocolate candy(60.92) is higher ranked than fruity candy(44.11).

-   first find all chocolate candy (subset)
-   get their winpercent values
-   summarize these values into one metric
-   do the same for fruity candy and compare

```{r}
choc.inds <- as.logical(candy$chocolate)
choc.win <- candy[choc.inds,]$winpercent
mean(choc.win)

fruit.inds <- as.logical(candy$fruity)
fruit.win <- candy[fruit.inds,]$winpercent
mean(fruit.win)
```

> **Q12.** Is this difference statistically significant?

> **A12.** Yes. A very low p-value=2.871e-08 (close to zero) suggests that the observed difference is statistically significant.

```{r}
t.test(choc.win, fruit.win)
```

# 3. Overall Candy Rankings

> **Q13.** What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

> **A13.** The five least liked candy types are Nik L Nip, Boston Baked Beans, Chiclets, Super Bubble, Jawbusters

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds,], n=5)
```

> **Q14.** What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

> **A14.** The top 5 all time favorite candy types are Snickers, Kit Kat, Twix, Reese's Miniatures, Reese's Peanut Butter cup

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
tail(candy[inds,], n=5)
```

> **Q15.** Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

> **Q16.** This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col()+
  labs(x="Match-up Win Percent", y=NULL)

ggsave("barplot1.png", height = 10, width = 7)
```

> **Q17.** What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

> **A17.** The worst ranked chocolate candy is Sixlets

```{r}
chocolate_candies <- candy[candy$chocolate == 1, ]
worst_ranked_chocolate <- chocolate_candies[which.min(chocolate_candies$winpercent), ]
worst_ranked_chocolate
```

```{r}
my_cols <- rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
  ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent),)+
    geom_col(fill=my_cols)+
    labs(x="Match-up Win Percent", y=NULL)
  
ggsave("barplot2.png", height = 10, width = 7)
```

As shown in @fig-bar and @fig-grey, xxxx

> **Q18.** What is the best ranked fruity candy?

> **A18.** The best ranked fruity candy is Starburst.

```{r}
fruity_candies <- candy[candy$fruity == 1, ]
best_ranked_fruity <- fruity_candies[which.max(fruity_candies$winpercent), ]
best_ranked_fruity
```

# 4. Taking a look at pricepercent

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "red"

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 5)
```

> **Q19.** Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

> **A19.** Tootsie Roll Midgies is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
tail(candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```
```{r}
win_to_price_ratio <- candy$winpercent / candy$pricepercent
best_value_candy <- candy[which.max(win_to_price_ratio), ]
best_value_candy
```

> **Q20.** What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

> **A20.** The top 5 most expensive candy types are Nik L Nip, Nestle Smarties, Ring pop, Hershey's Krackel, Hershey's Milk Chocolate, and the least popular of these is Nik L Nip.

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```



# 5. Exploring the correlation structure

we will calculate all Pearson correlation values 

> **Q22.** Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

> **A22.** chocolate and fruity are 2 most anti-correlated variables. There are some other anti-correlated variables with minus values such as pluribus and bar, fruity and bar.

```{r}
library(corrplot)
cij <- cor(candy)
head(cij)
corrplot(cij)
```

> **Q23.** Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

> **A23.** Chocolate and winpercent are most positively correlated variables.


# 6. Principal Component Analysis

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=TRUE)
summary(pca)
plot(pca$rotation[,1])
```

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```

> **Q24.** What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

> **A24.** Fruity, pluribus, hard are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction. These make sense to me, since they all show anti-correlated relationships with many other variants like pricepercent and winpercent which "effectively" push them to one side of the plot.

```{r}
pc.loadings <- as.data.frame(pca$rotation)
ggplot(pc.loadings) + 
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(pc.loadings),PC1)) +
        geom_col()
```

```{r}
pc.score.results <- as.data.frame(pca$x)
  
p <- ggplot(pc.score.results) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, label=rownames(pc.score.results)) +
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 8)+
  labs(title = "PCA Candy Space", subtitle = "chocolated and fruity candy separation")+
  geom_point(col=my_cols)
p
```
